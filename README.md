#Java Exception Handling Examples

This repository demonstrates how to handle various checked and unchecked exceptions in Java using clean, organized, and OOP-compliant code. Each type of exception is encapsulated in its own handler class, and a main class is used to execute and demonstrate the examples.

#Project Structure
The project is divided into three main Java files:

CheckedExceptionHandler.java
Contains methods to simulate and handle checked exceptions, which include:

IOException
FileNotFoundException
EOFException
SQLException
ClassNotFoundException
UncheckedExceptionHandler.java
Contains methods to simulate and handle unchecked exceptions, which include:

ArithmeticException
NullPointerException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
ClassCastException
IllegalArgumentException
NumberFormatException
MainExceptionDemo.java
The entry point of the application. Demonstrates exception handling by instantiating the respective handlers and invoking their methods.

#Features
Encapsulation: Exception handling logic is neatly encapsulated in dedicated classes.
Reusability: Each exception simulation and handling is implemented as an independent method.
OOP Principles: Adheres to modularity and clean coding practices.
Comprehensive Coverage: Demonstrates both checked and unchecked exceptions in meaningful scenarios.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
A Java IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
Git for version control (optional).
